			A key recession indicator sounded alarm bells in markets this week. One slice of the yield curve — which maps interest rates on government bonds with different maturities — inverted, meaning that yields on shorter-term notes exceeded those of longer-term ones. 
		</div>
		<div class="block">
			A “normal” yield curve should be upward sloping, as debt with longer maturities carry higher interest rates to price in greater risk over time and opportunity costs. The warnings come when the curve flattens or slumps. When Treasury securities with shorter maturities boast higher returns, this reflects pessimism about current conditions — the more risky things seem, the more the bond has to pay to entice investors.

			Yield curve inversions don’t necessarily portend imminent recessions, given how many different measures there are. 
		</div>
		<div class="block">
			The 10-year/two-year curve has inverted three times this year; but one of the most preferred combinations is the 10-year and three-month spread, which is currently nowhere near the danger zone. According to the <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/capital_markets/ycfaq.html#/faq">New York Fed</a>, inversions of this specific combination have preceded nearly every single recession since 1960, making it a fairly robust predictor (with one exception being 1967). Fed chair Jerome Powell prefers an even <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-21/powell-says-look-at-short-term-yield-curve-for-recession-risk">shorter spread</a> between the 3-month yield and 18-month forward rate.

			Sky-high inflation, weaker economic data, and the Fed’s record interest-rate hikes have continued to stoke fears around a contracting economy. Inversions may seem like the latest recession harbinger, but economists caution against relying too heavily on any one indicator. The yield curve is, fundamentally, still just a reflection of what traders think is going to happen. 
		</div>
		<div class="block">
			“For the typical market participant to infer the likelihood of recession by looking at the yield curve—particularly the near-term forward spread—is akin to that participant looking in the mirror at himself to see if he fears a recession,” Fed economists wrote in a <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/the-near-term-forward-yield-spread-as-a-leading-indicator-a-less-distorted-mirror.htm">2019 paper</a>. “Even so, the yield curve does provide onlookers and policy makers with a tool for gauging the expectations of bond market participants.”
